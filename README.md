Event management system.
A service that will allow you to manage and coordinate events with ease.
In a large event, it is not easy to coordinate the tasks of all the volunteers and staff.
Texting and calling doesn't scale up.
This web app will allow you to see everyone and what tasks they are doing in real time. 
You can assign tasks to groups of people or individually, and then push the tasks to their phones where they will get a notification.
Simplify your even management with TeamUp!
